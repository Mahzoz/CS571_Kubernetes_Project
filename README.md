# kubernetes_project
This project uses the following techniques and runs on Google Kubernetes Engine

Techniques           | Usage
-------------------- | ---------------------
Pods                 | to run 2 applications
Service              | for outside access the application
Persistence Volumes  | to store the data with MongoDB
Ingress              | to expose both applications under same domain but different path
ConfigMaps           | to store MongoDB service address, in case MongoDB is down and restarts with a different service address, and with ConfigMaps, we don't need to build the docker image again with the new address
